# ðŸ§  CIFAR-10 Deep Learning Image Classifier (CustomTkinter GUI)

This project is a **deep learning-based image classification system** built using **TensorFlow** and **CustomTkinter**.  
It allows users to upload an image and get **real-time predictions** and **probabilities** for 10 CIFAR-10 classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.  

The system combines machine learning with a user-friendly desktop interface â€” perfect for learning or deployment demos.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset  
- âœ… Save and load the trained model automatically  
- âœ… Upload any image and get prediction + confidence  
- âœ… CustomTkinter-based modern GUI  
- âœ… Modular architecture (train, utils, GUI separated)  
- âœ… Easy to deploy using `run.py`
